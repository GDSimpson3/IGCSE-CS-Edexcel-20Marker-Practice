Here's a sample **20-mark Question 5** styled after an **IGCSE Edexcel Computer Science Paper 2** exam, which focuses on practical problem-solving and computational thinking. This question is modeled to be complex enough for a long-form answer within the final part of a 3-hour paper.

### **IGCSE Edexcel Computer Science - Paper 2 (Pseudocode/Practical Programming)**

**Question 5 \[20 marks]**

A sports club wants to create a computer program to manage the registration of participants for a triathlon event. The triathlon consists of swimming, cycling, and running segments. The program must:

* Allow a maximum of 50 participants to register. - DONE
* Store each participant’s name, age, and completion time for each segment.
* Calculate the total completion time for each participant. - DONE
* Identify and display the name of the participant with the fastest total time.
* Output a sorted list (ascending) of all participants by their total time.
* Only accept participants who are 16 years or older. - DONE

### Write an algorithm using pseudocode or a programming language of your choice to do the following:

a) Define appropriate data structures to store the data for all participants.

b) Allow new participants to register, ensuring the age restriction is enforced.

c) After all registrations, input each participant’s segment times.

d) Calculate and store each participant’s total time.

e) Identify the winner and display their name and total time.

f) Output the full list of participants sorted by total time, showing each name and total time.

### **Mark Scheme Overview (Summary):**

* \[4 marks] for effective use of data structures (arrays, lists, records/dictionaries).
* \[4 marks] for input validation and registration logic.
* \[4 marks] for correct time calculations.
* \[4 marks] for winner identification and output formatting.
* \[4 marks] for sorting and displaying the final results.
