Here’s a detailed **marking and feedback** for your solution based on the IGCSE Edexcel Computer Science Paper 2 criteria for a 20-mark extended response (like Question 5). Your code is functional, attempts validation, and meets most of the task requirements.

### **Mark Breakdown**

#### ✅ **Part (a) – Code (14 marks total)**

| Criteria                                           | Marks | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Input student names with limit (max 5)             | 2     | ✅ Correctly done with `studentCount` and early exit if name is empty.                                                                                                                                        |
| Input up to 3 quiz scores per student              | 2     | ✅ Uses nested loop and `quizCount` reset properly.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Score validation (0–100 inclusive)                 | 2     | ⚠️ Partially correct – should accept scores from 0 **to 100 inclusive**, but your condition `quizScore >= 100 or quizScore <= 0` **excludes 0 and 100**, which is incorrect. Use `score < 0 or score > 100`. |
| Average score calculated correctly                 | 2     | ✅ Correct use of loop to calculate average based on number of scores.                                                                                                                                        |
| Identification of student with highest average     | 2     | ✅ Correct logic using a comparison and index tracking.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Output of each student’s name, scores, and average | 2     | ✅ Clearly outputs data in a readable format.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Clear code structure and comments                  | 2     | ✅ Some comments present and variables named meaningfully. Could be slightly clearer in a few places (e.g., why index tracking is needed).                                                                    |

**Subtotal for (a): 13/14**

---

#### 🧠 **Part (b) – Explanation of validation (3 marks)**

You didn’t provide a written explanation in your submission, but based on your code and comments:

* ✅ You attempted score validation with a loop.
* ⚠️ Your comment mentions checking range, but doesn’t clarify the mistake in logic (excludes 0 and 100).
* ⚠️ The comment about breaking on `ValueError` assumes no more scores to enter, which is risky UX-wise – could be elaborated.

**Estimate: 2/3**

---

#### 💡 **Part (c) – Suggestion for improvement (3 marks)**

You didn’t include a written suggestion. A good suggestion would be:

> *"Add the ability to save data to a file so progress is not lost when the program closes. This helps the teacher review student performance later."*

Since this was not submitted, I’ll assume 0 unless you want to include it now.

**Current: 0/3**
(You can recover this by submitting one.)

### ✅ **Final Mark: 15/20**

---

### 📘 **Summary Feedback**

* Your code handles most tasks well and shows good structure.
* Be careful with your validation logic – off-by-one and boundary mistakes (e.g., `>=` vs `>`) are common but costly.
* The lack of written responses for parts (b) and (c) loses easy marks. Be sure to include them in an exam.

Let me know if you’d like help [rewriting your validation logic correctly](f) or [crafting a written suggestion for part (c)](f).
