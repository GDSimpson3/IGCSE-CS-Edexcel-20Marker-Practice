## **IGCSE Edexcel Computer Science – Paper 2: Practical Problem-Solving and Programming**

**Question 5 – 20 marks**

A teacher wants to develop a system to help track student progress on an online learning platform. Each student completes quizzes, and their scores need to be recorded and analyzed to generate performance summaries.

You are required to design and write a Python program that does the following:

* Allows the teacher to enter the names of up to 5 students.
* For each student, allows entry of up to 3 quiz scores (out of 100).
* Validates that all scores are between 0 and 100.
* Calculates the average score for each student.
* Identifies and displays the student with the highest average score.
* Outputs each student’s name, scores, and average score.

Your solution must include:

(a) A well-commented Python program that meets all the requirements above.
(b) An explanation of how you validated the data.
(c) A suggestion for one improvement or extension to your program and why it would be useful.
