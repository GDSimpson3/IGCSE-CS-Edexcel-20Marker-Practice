My answer: Part C: The data collected could be stored into a file (perhaps a CSV spreadsheet). Later this data can be usefull to show the progress of students over the years


Markscheme: 

Great! Thatâ€™s a **valid and useful suggestion** for part (c), and here's how it scores:

---

### ðŸ’¡ **Part (c) â€“ Suggestion for improvement (3 marks)**

| Criteria               | Mark | Justification                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Relevant improvement   | âœ…    | Storing data in a file is highly practical.                        |
| Explanation of benefit | âœ…    | You explained it's useful for tracking student progress over time. |
| Clear and realistic    | âœ…    | Saving to a CSV is achievable with your current program.           |

**Full marks awarded: 3/3**

### âœ… **Updated Final Mark: 18/20**

Excellent work overallâ€”just fix the score validation condition and youâ€™ve got a top-band solution.

Let me know if youâ€™d like to [add file-saving functionality using Python](f) or [revise the score validation logic together](f).
